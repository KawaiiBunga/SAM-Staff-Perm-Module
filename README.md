# SAM-Staff-Perm-Module
Make it so only a set DarkRP job can use certain SAM commands

Super simple to use and setup.

Drop the addons folder into your server directory and confugre the staff_perms.lua file to your liking.

This should allow you to restrict any sort of command to a certain job. I use it for staff perms on DarkRP, but it could be used for other things too.

This is setup as a sam module, so try to leave the folder structure alone if you don't already have any extra SAM modules installed. The staff_perms.lua can be added to your existing sam-modules folder (if you have one) in lua/sam/modules, and you can disregard the folder structure completely.
